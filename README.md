View Station Software

This is my WPF version of the view station software!  
It looks at a network drive to display the pictures.  
The picture are seperated into folders to help it load faster and make it easier to find.
ex. 1-10 , 11-20, ect

The user navigates to the picture through the use of buttons labeled with folder name.
Once the user finds the photo, they can add the item to the shopping cart and keep shopping or checkout!
At check out they can review the order, remove items and enter thier information and press the submit button.

At this point the pictures with a xml version of the order information are copied to a folder on the orders 
network drive with the name of the person who ordered it.
